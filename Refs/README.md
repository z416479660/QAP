Simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is a popular metaheuristic which has been widely used to solve many continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. 
Temperature cooling scheme is one of the key factors for its promising performance. 
Several studies have shown that reannealing can improve SA's performance on quadratic assignment problem (QAP). 
Using the benchmark instances from QAPLIB, this paper carried systematic experiments to compare the effect of reannealing on performance of inhomogeneous SA (ISA). 
Simulation results show that: (1) although reannealing can improve ISA's performance in general, it may has no effect on some type of QAP instances; 
(2) parameters for cooling schedule are not only sensitive to the type of QAP instance, but sensitive to the specific instance also; 
(3) the timing to activate the reannealing is sensitive to the type of QAP instances also. 

### List-based Simulated Annealing Algorithm with Hybrid Greedy Repair and Optimization Operator for 0-1 Knapsack Problem
List-based Simulated annealing (LBSA) algorithm, which uses list-based cooling scheme to control the change of parameter temperature, was first proposed for traveling salesman problem. 
This paper extends the application of LBSA algorithm for 0-1 knapsack problem (0-1 KP). 
A hybrid greedy repair and optimization operator, which combines density-based and value-based greedy repair and optimization operators, is designed to get better balance between intensification and diversification. 
Extensive experiments were performed to show the effectiveness and parameter robustness of list-based cooling scheme, and to verify the advantage of using hybrid greedy repair and optimization operator. 
Comparing experiments, which were conducted on small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale 0-1 KP instances, have shown that LBSA algorithm is better than or competitive with other state-of-the-art metaheuristics.

### Hybrid metaheuristics in combinatorial optimization: A survey
Research in metaheuristics for combinatorial optimization problems has lately experienced a noteworthy shift towards the hybridization of metaheuristics with other techniques for optimization. 
At the same time, the focus of research has changed from being rather algorithm-oriented to being more problem-oriented. 
Nowadays the focus is on solving the problem at hand in the best way possible, rather than promoting a certain metaheuristic. 
This has led to an enormously fruitful cross-fertilization of different areas of optimization. 
This cross-fertilization is documented by a multitude of powerful hybrid algorithms that were obtained by combining components from several different optimization techniques. 
Hereby, hybridization is not restricted to the combination of different metaheuristics but includes, for example, the combination of exact algorithms and metaheuristics. 
In this work we provide a survey of some of the most important lines of hybridization. The literature review is accompanied by the presentation of illustrative examples.

### Hyper-heuristics--A survey of the state of the art
Hyper-heuristics comprise a set of approaches that are motivated (at least in part) by the goal of automating the design of heuristic methods to solve hard computational search problems. 
An underlying strategic research challenge is to develop more generally applicable search methodologies. 
The term hyper-heuristic is relatively new; it was first used in 2000 to describe heuristics to choose heuristics in the context of combinatorial optimisation. 
However, the idea of automating the design of heuristics is not new; it can be traced back to the 1960s. 
The definition of hyper-heuristics has been recently extended to refer to a search method or learning mechanism for selecting or generating heuristics to solve computational search problems. 
Two main hyper-heuristic categories can be considered: heuristic selection and heuristic generation. 
The distinguishing feature of hyper-heuristics is that they operate on a search space of heuristics (or heuristic components) rather than directly on the search space of solutions to the underlying problem that is being addressed. 
This paper presents a critical discussion of the scientific literature on hyper-heuristics including their origin and intellectual roots, a detailed account of the main types of approaches, and an overview of some related areas. 
Current research trends and directions for future research are also discussed.

### Evaluating selection methods on hyper-heuristic multi-objective particle swarm optimization
Multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is a promising meta-heuristic to solve multi-objective problems (MOPs). 
Previous works have shown that selecting a proper combination of leader and archiving methods, which is a challenging task, improves the search ability of the algorithm. 
A previous study has employed a simple hyper-heuristic to select these components, obtaining good results. 
In this research, an analysis is made to verify if using more advanced heuristic selection methods improves the search ability of the algorithm. 
Empirical studies are conducted to investigate this hypothesis. In these studies, first, four heuristic selection methods are compared: a choice function, a multi-armed bandit, a random one, and the previously proposed roulette wheel. 
A second study is made to identify if it is best to adapt only the leader method, the archiving method, or both simultaneously. Moreover, the influence of the interval used to replace the low-level heuristic is analyzed. 
At last, a final study compares the best variant to a hyper-heuristic framework that combines a Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm into the multi-objective optimization based on decomposition with dynamical resource allocation (MOEA/D-DRA) and a state-of-the-art MOPSO. 
Our results indicate that the resulting algorithm outperforms the hyper-heuristic framework in most of the problems investigated. 
Moreover, it achieves competitive results compared to a state-of-the-art MOPSO.
